# Semi-Parametric-Survival-Analysis-Cox-Proportional-Hazards-Model-

Semi-Parametric Survival Analysis with Cox Proportional-Hazards Model
This project demonstrates the implementation of the Cox Proportional-Hazards Model, a semi-parametric statistical technique used for survival analysis. The Cox model is employed to investigate the association between the survival time of patients and predictor variables, such as drug treatment and other covariates.

Project Description
The project involves loading a dataset containing information about drug use, relapse, and survival time. It performs data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, and then proceeds to fit the Cox Proportional-Hazards Model using the lifelines library in Python. The model summary and hazard ratios are printed, and the survival curves are plotted for visual analysis.

Getting Started
To run this project, you'll need Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
lifelines
You can install the required libraries using pip:


Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib lifelines
Usage
Clone the repository or download the project files.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the Python script containing the code.
The script will load the dataset, preprocess the data, fit the Cox Proportional-Hazards Model, and display the model summary, hazard ratios, and survival curves.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available at the following URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KenDaupsey/Non-Parametric-Survival-Analysis-2-Log-Rank-Non-Parametric-Survival-Analysis-Test-/main/Survival%7EDrug%7EUse%7ERelapse.csv
